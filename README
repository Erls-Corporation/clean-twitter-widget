Want a twitterstream in your website, but don't want all the clutter from the official Twitter Embed?
I took the official widget and removed most of the styling as well as the logos and link to twitter.
Now it's just your tweets and you can style them anyway you want.

It's all hacked together a bit as I just removed stuff from the original script without caring to refactor or clean it. 
It works for me and should work for you too, but feel free to fork and make a cleaner and possibly configurable version - I just don't have the time right now. Enjoy.
